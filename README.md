In today’s world, fitness has become one of the most important aspects of a healthy lifestyle. For athletes, it is essential to measure their physical potential through exercises such as push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, dips, boxing punches, and squats—either to monitor improvement or to count repetitions for record-keeping and competitive purposes.
The PoseFit application assists users by automatically counting push-up repetitions using posture analysis. It works by normalizing the three coordinates of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, and calculating the angle between the two vectors formed by these points.
As part of its future scope, additional exercises such as pull-ups, sit-ups, dips, boxing punches, and squats will be integrated into the application.
To use the application: import the attached files, open the command prompt in the folder containing all files, and run the following commands:
1-"pip install -r requirements.txt"
2-"streamlit run app.py"
